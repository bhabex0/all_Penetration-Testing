          Penetration testing report key findings
A penetration testing report is a comprehensive document that outlines the results of a simulated cyber attack on an organizationâ€™s computer system or network. The report provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerabilities found, the potential impact of an attack, and recommendations for remediation. Here are some key findings that a penetration testing report may include:

Executive Summary

A high-level overview of the test results, including the most critical vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation.
A summary of the test objectives, scope, and methodology used.
An executive summary should be written in a non-technical language to facilitate understanding by non-technical stakeholders.
Technical Findings

A detailed description of the vulnerabilities found, including:
Vulnerability type (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
Severity level (e.g., low, medium, high, critical)
Potential impact (e.g., data breach, system compromise, etc.)
Remediation steps
A list of the vulnerabilities found, including the affected systems, services, and applications.
Risk Assessment

A risk assessment of the vulnerabilities found, including:
Likelihood of exploitation
Potential impact of an attack
Overall risk score
A risk matrix or graph to visualize the risk assessment.
Recommendations

A list of remediation steps to address the vulnerabilities found, including:
Technical recommendations (e.g., patching, configuration changes, etc.)
Procedural recommendations (e.g., training, process changes, etc.)
Policy recommendations (e.g., security policy updates, etc.)
Appendices

Additional information that supports the findings and recommendations, including:
Screenshots and diagrams
Technical details of the vulnerabilities found
References to relevant standards and regulations
Glossary of technical terms used in the report.
Key Takeaways

A penetration testing report should provide a comprehensive overview of the vulnerabilities found and the potential impact of an attack.
The report should include a clear and concise executive summary, technical findings, risk assessment, and recommendations for remediation.
The report should be written in a clear and technical language, with minimal jargon and technical terms.
The report should include appendices to provide additional information and support the findings and recommendations.
