          Penetration testing report key findings
A penetration testing report is a comprehensive document that outlines the results of a simulated cyber attack on an organization’s computer system or network. The report provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerabilities found, the potential impact of an attack, and recommendations for remediation. Here are some key findings that a penetration testing report may include:

Executive Summary

- A high-level overview of the test results, including the most critical vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation. <br>
- A summary of the test objectives, scope, and methodology used.<br>
- An executive summary should be written in a non-technical language to facilitate understanding by non-technical stakeholders.<br><br><br>

Technical Findings<br>

- A detailed description of the vulnerabilities found, including:<br>
     -Vulnerability type (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)<br>
    -Severity level (e.g., low, medium, high, critical)<br>
     -Potential impact (e.g., data breach, system compromise, etc.)<br>
    -Remediation steps<br>
  -A list of the vulnerabilities found, including the affected systems, services, and applications.<br><br><br><br>


Risk Assessment<br>

-A risk assessment of the vulnerabilities found, including:
            -Likelihood of exploitation<br>
             -Potential impact of an attack<br>
              - Overall risk score<br>
-A risk matrix or graph to visualize the risk assessment.<br>


Recommendations<br>

-A list of remediation steps to address the vulnerabilities found, including:
              - Technical recommendations (e.g., patching, configuration changes, etc.)<br>
               - Procedural recommendations (e.g., training, process changes, etc.)<br>
               - Policy recommendations (e.g., security policy updates, etc.)<br><br>



Appendices<br>

- Additional information that supports the findings and recommendations, including:<br>
          - Screenshots and diagrams<br>
           - Technical details of the vulnerabilities found<br>
            - References to relevant standards and regulations<br>
            - Glossary of technical terms used in the report.<br>
<br><br><br>


Key Takeaways<br><br>

- A penetration testing report should provide a comprehensive overview of the vulnerabilities found and the potential impact of an attack.<br>
- The report should include a clear and concise executive summary, technical findings, risk assessment, and recommendations for remediation.<br>
- The report should be written in a clear and technical language, with minimal jargon and technical terms.<br>
- The report should include appendices to provide additional information and support the findings and recommendations.
